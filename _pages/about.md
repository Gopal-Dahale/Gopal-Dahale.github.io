![A gate-based quantum computer](/images/qc.png){: .align-right width="200px"}

👨🏻‍💻 I’m a Research Software Engineer at Qkrishi.

🔬 My research interests are in quantum computing and its applications in machine learning, chemistry and combinatorial optimization.

📚 I’m currently exploring hybrid algorithms for neutral-atom quantum hardware.

📽️ I am also happy to assist anyone on their journey in quantum computing.

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Experience

Currently I am working as a Research Software Engineer at Qkrishi, a quantum finance focused startup, where I am tackling problems like portfolio optimization and fraud detection. Additionally, I have participated in Google Summer of Code with ML4SCI in 2022 and 2023. There I worked on quantum neural networks for HEP data classification.

## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions

To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I have a [Medium](https://medium.com/@dahalegopal27) channel where I publish educational Quantum Computing content. I also write frequently on my personal blog site, [ILearnQuantum](https://gopal-dahale.github.io/ILearnQuantum/).
