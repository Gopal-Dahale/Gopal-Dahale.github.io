![A gate-based quantum computer](/images/qc.png){: .align-right width="200px"}

👨🏻‍💻 I’m a Research Software Engineer at Qkrishi.

🔬 My research interests include in quantum computing and its applications in machine learning, chemistry and combinatorial optimization.

📚 I’m currently exploring hybrid algorithms for neutral-atom quantum hardware.

📽️ I am also happy to assist anyone on their journey in quantum computing.

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Experience

Currently, working as a Research Software Engineer at Qkrishi, a quantum finance-focused startup. I tackle problems like portfolio optimization and fraud detection.

In 2022 and 2023, I participated in Google Summer of Code with ML4SCI. There I worked on quantum neural networks for HEP data classification.

I am also a Qiskit Advocate and studied tensor network quantum circuits during the Qiskit Advocate Mentorship Program in Fall 2022. In the past, I participated in IBM Quantum challenges; these [badges](https://www.credly.com/users/gopal-ramesh-dahale/badges) highlight the journey.

## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions

To further contribute to the quantum computing community, I have a [Medium](https://medium.com/@dahalegopal27) channel where I publish educational Quantum Computing content. I frequently publish blog posts on [ILearnQuantum](https://gopal-dahale.github.io/ILearnQuantum/) with a 0.1 probability.
